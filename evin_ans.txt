Egg

Well, although I've heard of this question, never have I thought about it myself. Since I have to in this moment of time, I guess I'll put my thinking caps on.
On my basis, probably the chicken should come 'cause SOMETHING has to lay the egg right? But nothing is ever so simple. So I decided to look it up online.
I found countless articles regarding the same but one was particularly interesting. In it was both a scientific and a philosphical approach. I'm not getting into the details but it concluded with one gorgeous statement from Neil deGrasse Tyson : "Just to settle it once and for all: Which came first the chicken or the egg? The egg ï¿½ laid by a bird that was not a chicken.".
